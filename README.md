Launcher mod by PRYtheSheep.
WIP.
To figure out:
Better text parser for LauncherBE (somewhat done)
Animations for LauncherBER
Redesign launcher platform
Adjust launcher design
Refactor the ShellItemEntity, so it extends from a parent class
Create a "tracer shell" that extends from the said parent class
Or make an interface for the above 2
Create a blockOutlineRenderer for the "tracer shell" to draw its flightpath
